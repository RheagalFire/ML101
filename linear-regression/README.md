# Linear Regression

### What is Linear Regression?&#x20;

Linear Regression is a Supervised ML algorithm that selects the best fit line between dependent and independent variables&#x20;

$$
y=ax+b+c ;  yi= Actual ; y=predicted
$$

$$
Minimize (1/2mâˆ‘(y-yi)^2) ; Cost Function

You can check out the scratch demonstration of this algorithm [here](https://github.com/RheagalFire/Scratch-Implementations/blob/master/Linear%20Regression.ipynb).

### What are the Basic Assumptions of Linear Regression?

* Linearity: The relationship between X and the mean of Y is linear.
* Homoscedasticity: The variance of residual is the same for any value of X.
* Independence: Observations are independent of each other.
* Normality: For any fixed value of X, Y is normally distributed.

### Advantages of Linear Regression&#x20;

* Linear regression performs exceptionally well for linearly separable data
* Easy to implement and train the model
* It can handle overfitting using dimensionality reduction techniques and cross-validation and regularization

### Disadvantages of Linear Regression

* Prone to Noise and Overfitting.
* Lot of Feature Engineering Required
* Does not perform well if independent variables are correlated with each other.
* It is sensitive to missing values.
* Sensitive to outliers.
