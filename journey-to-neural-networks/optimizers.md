# Optimizers

There are many different optimization algorithms used in deep learning, and each algorithm has its own specific set of formulas and equations that are used to update the model's parameters. Some of the most commonly used optimization algorithms in deep learning include:

* Stochastic Gradient Descent (SGD): This algorithm uses the gradient of the loss function with respect to the model's parameters to update the parameters in the opposite direction of the gradient. The update rule for SGD is typically given by the following formula:

w(t+1) = w(t) - learning\_rate \* gradient(w(t))

where w(t) is the current value of the model's parameters, learning\_rate is a hyperparameter that controls the step size of the updates, and gradient(w(t)) is the gradient of the loss function with respect to the model's parameters at time t.

* Momentum: This algorithm is similar to SGD, but it introduces a momentum term that helps the algorithm to converge more quickly by "carrying" the updates in the direction of previous gradients. The update rule for momentum is typically given by the following formula:

v(t+1) = momentum \* v(t) - learning\_rate \* gradient(w(t)) w(t+1) = w(t) + v(t+1)

where v(t) is the momentum vector, which is initialized to 0, and the other terms are the same as in the SGD update rule.

* AdaGrad: This algorithm is designed to adapt the learning rate to the specific characteristics of each parameter, so that the learning rate is larger for infrequent parameters and smaller for frequent parameters. The update rule for AdaGrad is typically given by the following formula:

cache(t+1) = cache(t) + gradient(w(t))^2 w(t+1) = w(t) - learning\_rate \* gradient(w(t)) / (sqrt(cache(t+1)) + epsilon)

where cache(t) is the sum of the squares of the gradients of the loss function with respect to the model's parameters, and epsilon is a small constant used to prevent division by zero.

* Adam: This algorithm is a combination of SGD, momentum, and AdaGrad, and it has been shown to work well in many deep learning applications. The update rule for Adam is typically given by the following formula:

m(t+1) = beta1 \* m(t) + (1 - beta1) \* gradient(w(t)) v(t+1) = beta2 \* v(t) + (1 - beta2) \* gradient(w(t)^2) w(t+1) = w(t) - learning\_rate \* m(t+1) / (sqrt(v(t+1)) + epsilon)

where m(t) and v(t) are the moving averages of the gradient and the squared gradient, respectively, and beta1 and beta2 are hyperparameters that control the decay rates of the moving averages.

These are just a few examples of the many different optimization algorithms used in deep learning, and there are many other algorithms that use different formulas and equations to update the model's parameters. It is important to understand the underlying principles of each algorithm and to experiment with different algorithms to find the one that works best for your specific application.
